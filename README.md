- We provide an end-to-end approach (Repro. layer) to reprogram on time series data on `raw waveform` with a differential mel-spectrogram layer from kapre. 

- No offiline acoustic feature extraction and all layers are differentiable.

- Pytorch version of reprogram layer could be found out in [ICASSP 23 Music Reprogramming](https://github.com/biboamy/music-repro).

- updated: if you have used the `ECG 200` dataset in this code, please `git pull` and refer to the issue for [one reported label loading error](https://github.com/huckiyang/Voice2Series-Reprogramming/issues/1). (has been fixed)

### Theoretical Discussion

- For sliced wasserstein distance mapping and theoretical analysis, we use the [POT](https://pythonot.github.io) package ([JMLR 2021](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume22/20-451/20-451.pdf)).

- The population risk for the target task via reprogramming a K-way source neural network classifier is upper bounded by equation above.



### FAQ

- 1. Tips for tuning the model?

I would recommend using different label mapping numbers for training. For instance, you could use `--mapping 7` for `ECG 5000` dataset. The dropout rate is also an important hyperparameter for tuning the testing loss. You could use a range between `0.2` to `0.5` with `--dr 4` for `0.4` dropout rate.

- 2. Masking the target sequence is important?

V2S [mask](https://github.com/huckiyang/Voice2Series-Reprogramming/blob/main/ts_model.py#L53) is provided as an option, but the training script is not using the masking for forwarding passing. From our experiments, using or not using the masking only has small variants on the performance. This is not in conflict with the proposed theoretical analysis on learning target domain adaption.

- 3. Can we use Voice2Series for other domains or collaberate with the team?

Yes, you are welcome. Please send an email to the author for potential collaberation.
